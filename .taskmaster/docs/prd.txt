Overview
The workout app is designed to streamline the process of creating, assigning, managing, and tracking personalized workout programs for trainers and their clients. It addresses the challenge of delivering tailored fitness guidance efficiently, ensuring data integrity, and fostering clear communication between trainers and trainees. The product aims to enhance the personalized fitness journey for trainees while empowering trainers to effectively manage their client rosters and program evolution.

Core Features
1. Creating a Trainee Account
What it does: This feature allows new individuals to independently sign up for an account as a trainee. They provide essential personal and contact information (name, date of birth, email) to establish their unique profile. Upon successful signup, trainees receive a confirmation and gain immediate access to their personal dashboard. 



Why it's important: This is foundational to the entire product, enabling rapid user acquisition by reducing onboarding friction. 


How it works at a high level: A new trainee accesses a signup interface, inputs their details, receives a confirmation, and is then directed to their personal dashboard. 


2. Managing Movements (Admin & Trainer)

What it does: This feature provides a centralized, admin-controlled library of individual exercises, called "movements." Each movement includes a title, description, and an accompanying video/GIF. Admins add and categorize movements (e.g., "Lower Body," "Upper Body," muscle groups) and review trainer requests for new variations. Trainers can search and filter this library, view movement details (video, description), and request new movement variations. Trainees can view the visual demonstrations and descriptions of assigned movements. 






Why it's important: It ensures consistency and accuracy across the platform, provides trainers with a comprehensive toolkit, supports specialization, improves trainee understanding and safety, and facilitates scalability. 

How it works at a high level: Admins manage the master movement library. Trainers access this library to select movements for workouts. Trainees view the movement details within their assigned workouts. 





3. Building a Workout (Template Creation)

What it does: This feature allows trainers to create reusable workout templates by selecting movements from the movement library and ordering them. Trainers can specify parameters like sets, reps, weight (lbs, percentage, or bodyweight), or time for each exercise. They can also add text notes, group exercises into supersets/circuits, and include warm-up/cool-down movements. Completed workouts can be saved as templates for future reuse. 






Why it's important: It enables trainers to structure diverse and effective workout plans efficiently, varying parameters to fit specific trainee needs. 


How it works at a high level: Trainers interact with a workout builder interface, pulling from the movement library, arranging exercises, and defining parameters before saving as a template. 





4. Editing a Workout (Templates & Instances)

What it does: This feature allows trainers to modify existing workout routines. 


Editing Workout Templates: Trainers can change the title, description, and tags of a master workout plan. They can also reorder, add, or delete exercises, and modify exercise parameters (sets, reps, weight, time). Changes only affect 




future assignments of the template. 



Modifying a Workout Instance for a Client: Trainers can make unique changes to a specific workout already assigned to an individual client without affecting the original template. This includes changing the title, description, and tags specific to that client's workout, and managing exercises (reorder, add, delete, modify parameters). 






Why it's important: Enhances trainer efficiency by allowing reuse of templates and enables client personalization by adapting workouts to individual needs without creating new ones from scratch. 

How it works at a high level: Trainers access either a template editing interface or a client-specific workout instance interface to make modifications. Changes are saved and applied based on whether it's a template (future assignments) or an instance (immediate for that client). 





5. Modifying a Movement based on Client Need (within a Workout Instance)

What it does: This feature allows trainers to upload or assign specific instructional videos or GIFs for individual exercises within a client's assigned workout. These custom media files are visible only to that specific client and override the default movement library video. Trainers can also add specific notes or modify textual details for a movement in a client's workout. Changes are reflected immediately in the client's app. 






Why it's important: Provides tailored visual guidance based on a trainee's fitness level, form, or equipment, improving safety and outcomes by reinforcing form and technique. 


How it works at a high level: Within a client's specific workout instance, trainers can select an exercise and either upload a new video/GIF or choose from their media library, or add/edit text notes, which then display to the client. 





6. Assigning a Client

What it does: This feature connects existing clients within the system to trainers, establishing the core trainer-trainee relationship. It includes initial assignment of available clients to a trainer and a robust client transfer system. Clients can request to add or switch trainers, and trainers can request or send clients to other trainers. During transfers, specific protocols manage visibility, preserving workout history. Trainers are notified of transfer status (pending, declined) and can view client status. It also includes functionality to ensure inactive or deleted client accounts cannot be requested for transfer, and notifies trainers if a client cancels during a transfer. 






Why it's important: Underpins the core trainer-trainee relationship, empowering trainers to manage rosters and deliver tailored experiences, while providing clarity for trainees. Crucial for data integrity and preventing ownership confusion. Also allows trainees to access content without a trainer. 




How it works at a high level: Trainers access a list of available clients, select and assign them. For transfers, requests are initiated by trainers or clients, with notifications and status updates guiding the process. 




7. Scheduling a Workout (Instance)

What it does: Allows trainers to assign specific workout templates or existing workout instances to trainees on chosen dates, supporting one-time and recurring assignments. Trainers can view client schedules in a calendar format, reschedule workouts, and receive notifications for missed workouts or client rescheduling requests. Trainees see assigned workouts on a calendar, can request to reschedule trainer-assigned workouts, and can self-schedule purchased workouts. Notifications (push) are sent to trainees before scheduled workouts. 






Why it's important: Organizes the training plan for trainees, provides clear visibility of upcoming activities, and enables trainers to manage and adapt schedules. 

How it works at a high level: Trainers select a client, choose a workout (template or instance), set a date and recurrence (if any), and assign it. The system manages calendar views and notification triggers for both parties. 





8. Unassigning a Client

What it does: Enables a trainer to formally end their association with a trainee. Upon unassignment, the trainer is prompted for confirmation, the trainee is removed from the trainer's active client dashboard, and the trainer loses access to their current/historical data for that client. All past workout records remain accessible to the trainee. Future workouts previously assigned by the unassigned trainer remain visible to the trainee but include an indicator that the originating trainer is inactive. Trainees receive in-app and email notifications of unassignment. All trainee data is retained for potential re-engagement, and the system tracks current vs. past clients for reporting. 






Why it's important: Maintains clear and accurate trainer-trainee relationships, allows trainers to manage their roster efficiently, preserves valuable workout history for trainees, ensures data hygiene, and reduces clutter. 


How it works at a high level: Trainers initiate the unassignment, confirm the action, and the system updates relationship status, access permissions, and sends notifications. 





9. Deleting a Workout (Templates & Instances)

What it does: Allows trainers to delete both reusable workout templates and specific workout instances assigned to clients. 


Deleting a Workout Template: Removes the template from availability for future assignments, without affecting existing client workouts based on that template. Past assignment history for the template is also removed from the trainer's view. 






Deleting a Workout Instance: Allows trainers to remove upcoming client sessions with a confirmation and an "undo" option (within 30 days). If a workout instance has past completed data, the trainer is warned, but any recorded performance data is 



always preserved for historical tracking, even if the workout itself is removed from the client's current schedule. Trainees do not receive notifications for deleted instances, and the workout simply disappears from their schedule. 






Why it's important: Crucial for maintaining an organized and flexible platform, allowing trainers to manage content, correct errors, and adapt programs without losing valuable client progress data. Ensures trainees consistently see relevant, current assignments. 


How it works at a high level: Trainers select a template or instance to delete. For instances, a confirmation and undo option are provided. The system handles the deletion logic, ensuring data retention for completed performance.

Risks and Mitigations
Technical Challenges (P0 & P1):

Media Upload/Streaming (P0-2, P1-3): Handling various video/GIF formats, efficient storage, and smooth streaming.

Mitigation: Research and select a robust third-party video hosting/streaming solution (e.g., Cloudinary, Vimeo API). Start with a limited set of supported file formats and expand based on need. Implement robust error handling for uploads.

Real-time Updates (P1-2, P1-3): Ensuring immediate reflection of trainer changes in trainee app.

Mitigation: Utilize WebSockets or similar real-time communication protocols. Implement efficient caching and invalidation strategies.

Data Integrity during Transfers/Deletions (P1-4, P1-5, P2-2): Preserving workout history during client transfers and ensuring performance data is retained even when workouts are deleted.

Mitigation: Implement clear data ownership rules and robust database transactions. Use soft deletes for critical entities (workouts, clients) where full deletion might cause data loss or auditing issues. Conduct thorough testing of all transfer and deletion scenarios, especially edge cases.

Figuring out the MVP that we can build upon (Overall):

Scope Creep: Tendency to add more features than initially planned for MVP.

Mitigation: Strict adherence to P0 requirements. Clearly define "done" for each P0 task. Ruthlessly prioritize based on core user journey for trainer-led workout assignment. Use the "Logical Dependency Chain" to ensure foundational elements are prioritized.

Underestimation of Complexity: Features that seem simple (e.g., notifications, search) can have hidden complexities.

Mitigation: Conduct thorough technical spikes and design sessions for each major component. Break down features into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. Engage engineers early in the PRD refinement process.

Resource Constraints (Overall):

Limited Development Capacity: Not enough engineers/designers to build everything desired.

Mitigation: Prioritize P0 features rigorously. Be prepared to cut features or delay them to future phases (P1, P2, P3). Focus on delivering a functional core product rather than a feature-rich but incomplete one. Continuously evaluate team bandwidth and adjust scope as needed.

Skill Gaps: Team might lack expertise in specific areas (e.g., video streaming, complex notification systems).

Mitigation: Invest in training, hire external consultants, or consider off-the-shelf solutions/APIs for specialized components where appropriate.

Appendix
Research Findings
Trainer Needs: Trainers consistently seek efficient ways to manage client rosters, personalize workout plans without excessive manual effort, and track client progress. The ability to modify workouts on a client-specific basis is highly valued.

Trainee Needs: Trainees require clear, accessible instructions for exercises, visual guidance, and a straightforward view of their assigned workouts. Data continuity (historical progress) is important, even if trainer relationships change.

Market Gap: Many existing platforms either lack granular workout customization or robust client transfer/management features, leading to trainer frustration and data silos.

Importance of Visuals: Exercise videos/GIFs are crucial for proper form and safety, especially for remote training. Customization of these visuals at the client level addresses unique needs.
