Initialize a new Git repository in the project root. 2. Create a directory structure with separate folders for frontend and backend components (e.g., 'frontend/' and 'backend/'). 3. Inside each folder, initialize a new package.json (use npm init -y for Node.js projects). 4. Add a README.md file at the project root with a project overview and setup instructions. 5. Create a .gitignore file to exclude node_modules and other unnecessary files. 6. Make an initial commit with the basic structure. 7. (Optional) Set up remote repository (e.g., GitHub) and push the initial commit.\n</info added on 2025-07-02T18:34:02.752Z>",
